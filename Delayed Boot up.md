culprits are:


bad CMOS / BIOS configuration (but how?)

corrupt save that was created by windows when it went to sleep that confuses the boot manager (how do I clean that?)

hardware ? (but which piece. Power supply is new and I went from 400 W Gold to 600 W, Gold, far exceeding my needs, after the windows turn on everything is stable and I have not experienced any crashes)

drivers?


If you have experienced this please let me know how you solved it.
