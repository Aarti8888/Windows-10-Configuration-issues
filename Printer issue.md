If your network printer doesnâ€™t show up, check the network connection using a ping test and reconnect the printer if needed. Add the printer


manually via Devices and Printers,


update its drivers, enable the Print Spooler service through services.msc,


or run the Printer Troubleshooter under Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot.
